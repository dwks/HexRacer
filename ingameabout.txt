=== HexRacer: What's this malarky?

HexRacer is a racing game!
Racing is when you go faster than other people because you hate them.

The goal of the game is to finish all the laps as fast as you can.
In the end, the averaged time of each team is how the game decides
which team is deserving of glory or shame.

HexRacer is tough, but fair.

--- Painting: Show your true colors!

Painting is integral to doing well in HexRacer. Lay down your paint on
the track, and when you or your same-colored teammates drive over it,
you'll get a speed boost! Use this boost to make your enemies weep.

To add insult to injury, players of other colors will slow down slightly
as they drive over your paint.

If you find yourself heading towards enemy paint, don't despair!
Erasing is here to help!
Erasing will clear any paint over which you drive.
Ruin the honest work of your adversaries! They probably deserve it.

!!! Caution!
You incur a speed penalty while painting or erasing, so think carefully!

--- Bonuses: Why get less when you can get MORE?

HexRacer has looked into its heart of obsidian and somehow found the
generosity to award bonus points for players that paint or erase
sufficient amounts.

As you paint or erase, you'll earn bonus time that will be subtracted
from your final race time. It could make all the difference! Or not!

 Pro-tip:
  The bonuses for erasing are much higher than painting, but it's much harder!

In addition, a massive bonus is awarded for your final placing among all players.
Remember the saying: Not first is not not worst.
