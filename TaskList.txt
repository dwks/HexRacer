Todo:

Driving Model:
- Friction!!!
- Set wheels to the actual wheel positions on the model
- Add better constraints to the wheels (prevent them from going inside the car or being too far below)
- Reduce overall bounciness of the vehicle

Camera:
- Eliminate jerkiness from Camera
- Fix debug camera (WASD)

Rendering:
- Visual indication when you have the paint speed boost (trim glow factor?)

Game Engine:
- Auto-reset the vehicle to the last path node when fallen off the track or flipped

Physics:
- Add at least one more dynamic object type to test the system (besides Player)
- Use MotionState properly
- Replace PhysicsWorld::collisionBodies with dynamicsWorld->getCollisionObjectArray()
- Create ObjectCollision event for sound?

GUI:
- List supported maps, allow the user to select one

Refactoring:
- refactor HRMap into several component parts
- remove Suspension's dependency on Renderer?
