Todo:

Driving Model:
- Friction!!!
- Set wheels to the actual wheel positions on the model
- Add better constraints to the wheels (prevent them from going inside the car or being too far below)
- Reduce overall bounciness of the vehicle

Physics:
- Add at least one more dynamic object type to test the system (besides Player)
- Use MotionState properly
- Replace PhysicsWorld::collisionBodies with dynamicsWorld->getCollisionObjectArray()

Refactoring:
- refactor HRMap into several component parts
