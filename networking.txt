To implement the new networking code with rollback, Historian needs:
- Proper clock synchronization. Send ping packets from the client to the server
  at least three times after receiving the WorldUpdate. [For now, can ignore
  this if the absolute time of day is used.]
- Knowledge of game state before each physics tick. Registering as a
  PhysicsTick observer and querying WorldManager for the physical state of
  players should do the trick.
- Knowledge of the time that each physics tick was supposed to occur at (could
  be passed through the PhysicsTick event).
- Knowledge of how far offset into the current bullet internal frame this
  game loop iteration is.
- All input events, so that frames can be replayed with acceleration etc.

Also, CameraObject should use a milliseconds-passed system rather than ticking
every 5 milliseconds.
