\subsection{Version control with git}

We used the distributed version control system git for this project. You can
type \emph{gitk} on a lab machine to see a graphical view of the history.

\subsection{Tour of the code}

...

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{src/log} contains a very complex logging system. The types of
        log messages are in TypeRegistry.cpp, logs are opened in LogOpener, and
        Logger is the main singleton class for logging.
    \item \emph{src/math} contains generic 4-D affine Point (also used for
        vectors) and Matrix classes.
    \item \emph{src/misc} is boring unless you count StreamAsString.
    \item \emph{src/opengl} contains the main OpenGL rendering classes,
        MainDisplay and KnotDisplay (for the upper and lower OpenGL frames
        respectively). It also has a Trackball.
    \item \emph{src/qtgui} contains the main Qt widget, MainWindow, and a base
        class of MainDisplay called OpenGLPortal.
\end{enumerate}
