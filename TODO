- Do something about sound...
- Make Singleton work under Windows (MSVC)
- Replace PhysicsWorld::collisionBodies with dynamicsWorld->getCollisionObjectArray()
- Rename Sleeper, and make Sleeper::getTimeMilliseconds() work at midnight

Notes
- Player needs to #include "PhysicalPlayer.h" which is quite the dependency ...
